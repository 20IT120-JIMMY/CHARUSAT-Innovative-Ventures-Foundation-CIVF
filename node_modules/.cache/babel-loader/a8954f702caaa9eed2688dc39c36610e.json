Our work on home\r\n            automation hit an indefinite halt when we ran out of supplies when\r\n            COVID hit. We participated in the ACM Month of Code Competition,\r\n            during which we identified that despite a good infrastructure, road\r\n            accident casualties have snowballed owing to the fact that ready\r\n            help is not available to people in the golden hour. Road\r\n            surveillance was happening but the people monitoring the footage\r\n            were scarce. To reduce the time taken to provide medical help to\r\n            victims, we built UltraviZ. It automates the surveillance, detects\r\n            accidents and sends alerts to concerned personnel.

Many of our batchmates, our\r\n            colleagues, seniors and faculties from both SVNIT and IIIT were\r\n            innovators and were in the constant pursuit of building things. That\r\n            encouraged us to take our idea forward. I hope every student can\r\n            find the inspiration to push the boundaries of possibilities as we\r\n            did.” says Krishna.\r\n          </span>\r\n        </p>\r\n
